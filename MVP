THE MAZE PROJECT - MVP
Overview:
The Maze Project is a 3D game developed using the SDL2 graphics library. This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements and the core user story that the game will fulfill.

MVP Features:
Walls:

Objective: Implement the maze structure with walls using a 2D array and SDL2 graphics.
Implementation:
Define a 2D array to represent the maze layout.
Use SDL2 to render walls as rectangles or lines.
Player Orientation:

Objective: Enable player movement and orientation control via arrow keys.
Implementation:
Handle user input using SDL_Event.
Adjust player position and orientation based on input.
Player Movement:

Objective: Allow the player to move in the maze (forward, backward, left, right).
Implementation:
Implement movement logic tied to the player’s orientation.
Collision Detection (Ouch):

Objective: Prevent the player from moving through walls.
Implementation:
Check for collisions between the player and walls.
Halt movement when a collision occurs.
Maze Data Parser:

Objective: Read maze data from a text file and store it in a 2D array.
Implementation:
Implement a parser to load maze data.
Store the maze data in the 2D array.
Maze Rendering:

Objective: Visually represent the maze on the screen.
Implementation:
Draw the maze using the 2D array data.
Use distinct colors for walls, ground, and ceiling.
Wall Textures:

Objective: Add textures to the walls for visual enhancement.
Implementation:
Load and render wall textures using SDL2’s texture functions.
User Story:
As an end-user, I want to play an engaging maze game created with SDL2, so I can challenge myself to navigate through the maze efficiently.

Key Requirements:
Main Menu:

Objective: Allow users to start a new game, load a saved game, or quit.
Features:
Select difficulty levels (maze size and obstacles).
Gameplay Experience:

Objective: Provide a smooth, responsive gameplay experience.
Features:
Control the character with arrow keys.
Display a countdown timer and score tracker.
Include collectible items like coins to increase score.
Introduce obstacles that challenge player navigation.
Game Completion:

Objective: Celebrate the user’s success upon completing the maze.
Features:
Show a congratulatory message with the final score and time.
Provide an option to save the game for future play.
Audio and Visuals:

Objective: Enhance the gaming experience with sound and graphics.
Features:
Implement sound effects for actions like collecting coins and hitting obstacles.
Play background music to complement the game’s atmosphere.
Ensure high-quality graphics and animations to keep the player engaged.
