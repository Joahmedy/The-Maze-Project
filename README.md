The Maze Project
Overview
The Maze Project is a simple game built using SDL2 where the player navigates through a 2D maze using raycasting techniques. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development, including rendering walls, handling player movement, and implementing textures.

Features
Raycasting: A technique used to render 2D walls and provide a pseudo-3D experience.
Player Movement: The player can move forward, backward, and rotate to navigate through the maze.
Textures: Textures are applied to walls, floors, and ceilings to enhance the visual experience.
Collision Detection: The player cannot walk through walls and is restricted to the maze path.
Map Rendering: The maze is rendered on the screen with the player's position and direction of sight.

Installation
Prerequisites
SDL2: Make sure SDL2 is installed on your system.
SDL2_image: Required for loading textures.
Building the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/The-Maze-Project.git
cd The-Maze-Project
Build the project:

bash
Copy code

Code Structure
src/: Contains the source files for the game.
main.c: The entry point of the game.
game.c: Handles game logic and rendering.
player.c: Manages player movement and actions.
raycasting.c: Implements the raycasting technique.
textures.c: Loads and applies textures to the game.
headers/: Contains header files with function prototypes and global variables.
header.h: Includes all necessary headers and definitions.
images/: Contains the textures used in the game.
wall.png: The texture applied to the walls.
Known Issues
Rendering Performance: The game may experience performance drops on lower-end machines due to the rendering complexity.
Collision Detection: The player may slide on walls, which might not be the desired effect.
Future Enhancements
Enemy AI: Add enemies that the player must avoid or defeat.
Weapon System: Implement weapons for the player to use.
Enhanced Textures: Add more detailed and varied textures for a better visual experience.
Map Editor: Create an in-game map editor for designing custom mazes.
